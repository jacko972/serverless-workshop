# Serverless Workshop
This Workshop is designed to teach yo the basics of how to use the serverless framework to build and deploy applications. Its not a lesson in coding in JavaScript / nodeJS by any means so please feel free to build on these examples and improve along the way to aid your learning.

## Requirements

You need to have installed and working knowledge of:

 - An AWS account (and your AWS keys setup on your machine see: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
 - Git
 - NodeJS

## Conventions

```

....
or some output
```

If a file or directory is referenced in the documentation it will be highlighted inline like so:

some generic text about file ```xyz.zip``` that you need to look at.

Important notes will be in bold like so:

## Clean up
Once you've finsihed this Workshop to delete all the resources created run:

```serverless remove```

from your code directory. This will prevent you incurring future costs.
